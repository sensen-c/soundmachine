Medium Article: A Third Listener - Emotion Detection in Customer Support

Background

Introducing “A Third Listener”, a machine learning model designed to analyze emotional cues in real-time during customer support interactions. By detecting emotional distress or dissatisfaction, the system can alert representatives or companies to adjust their approach, escalate the issue to experienced personnel, or modify the interaction strategy to better address the customer’s needs.

Resources used in the project are quoted in the Medium article’s reference section.
